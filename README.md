# Bomberman
Code written in Java within a month when I was in Grade 11.
Final Project for my Grade 12 Computer Science Course.
Sprites were taken off from the internet.

I am not sure how to make a .jar file with a Java Applet. 
Thus, to run the program, you need to open the project using an IDE like Eclipse and run the file "BomberManMain.java" (sorry)

Controls and rules can be read from the textfile that opens once the application runs. 
If I were to continue working on this, I would add more options for players such as initial power ups and maps.
I would also try and incorporate networking so that 4 players do not need to share a keyboard, but that would take tons of time.
